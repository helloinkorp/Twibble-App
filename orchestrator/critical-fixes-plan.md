**Date**: 2025-08-30
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Confidence**: 90% (Direct verification and targeted fixes needed)

## Critical Failures Identified

### 1. Chip Size NOT Applied ❌
- **User Report**: "chip size remains the same"
- **Expected**: 50-60% size reduction
- **Actual**: No visible change
- **Risk**: High - Core visual requirement not met

### 2. File Upload Completely Broken ❌  
- **User Report**: "file import isn't even uploading the words"
- **Expected**: File upload loads words to grids
- **Actual**: No words appear at all
- **Risk**: Critical - Core functionality broken

## Root Cause Analysis Required

### Chip Size Investigation

- Conflicting styles overriding changes
- calc() expressions not working correctly

### File Upload Investigation  
- JavaScript errors breaking file processing
- ChipManager integration failures
- File reader issues or promise rejections
- Event handler conflicts or missing bindings
