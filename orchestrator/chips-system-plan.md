# Chips System Implementation Plan
**TraceID**: trace-chips-system-2025-08-30
**Date**: 2025-08-30
**Confidence**: 85%

## Requirements Analysis (From Updated PRD)

### 1. Chip Color System
- **Vocabulary**: Pastel yellow background
- **Spelling**: Pastel mint background  
- **Phonics**: Pastel purple background
- **Multiple activities**: Gray background with colored dots (yellow=Vocab, mint=Spelling, purple=Phonics)

### 2. Drag-and-Drop Functionality
- Chips are draggable between different activity groups
- When reassigned, chip color changes to match the target group's activity
- Color maintained at all times (even when added to lesson words)

### 3. File Upload Integration
- Words imported via file upload separated into three default grids
- Default assignment to "Vocabulary" grid
- Users can move chips between grids (Vocabulary â†’ Spelling/Phonics)

## Task Decomposition

### T400: Chips Visual System Design
- **Responsibility**: Design the chip visual system with proper color coding
- **Output**: CSS classes for chip variants and color states
- **Validation**: Chips display correct colors per PRD specifications

### T401: Drag-and-Drop Infrastructure
- **Responsibility**: Implement drag-and-drop mechanics for chips
- **Output**: JavaScript drag-and-drop system with proper event handling
- **Validation**: Chips can be dragged between containers smoothly

### T402: Color State Management
- **Responsibility**: Manage chip color changes during reassignment
- **Output**: State management system for chip colors and activities
- **Validation**: Colors update correctly when chips are moved

### T403: File Upload Grid Integration
- **Responsibility**: Integrate file upload with grid system
- **Output**: File processing that loads words to default Vocabulary grid
- **Validation**: Imported words appear as chips in Vocabulary grid

### T404: Grid System Enhancement
- **Responsibility**: Enhance existing grid system to support drag-and-drop
- **Output**: Updated grid containers with drop zones
- **Validation**: Three grids (Vocab, Spelling, Phonics) accept chip drops

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Foundation First**: Build visual chip system
2. **Interaction Layer**: Add drag-and-drop functionality  
3. **State Management**: Implement color change logic
4. **Integration**: Connect with existing file upload and grid systems
5. **Validation**: Comprehensive testing of all interactions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Chips display correct pastel colors for single activities
- [ ] Multiple activity chips show gray with colored dots
- [ ] Drag-and-drop works smoothly between all grids
- [ ] Color changes happen immediately on reassignment
- [ ] File upload loads words to Vocabulary grid as chips
- [ ] All interactions work on mobile (touch-friendly)

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium Risk**: Complex drag-and-drop implementation
- **Medium Risk**: Color state synchronization
- **Low Risk**: CSS implementation
